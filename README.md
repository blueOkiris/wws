## Windows Workspace Switcher

## Description

A set of 10 status tray icons for clicking between virtual desktops and knowing which you're on.

Windows has virtual desktops, but I want to use them like i3 or a Linux DE where I can see which workspace I'm in and click between them. Useful in conjunction with FancyWM

You can click on them to select a workspace, it automatically sets workspaces to 10, and when you move desktops whether by clicking or with the keyboard or with some other way, they update to show the correct current desktop.

## Run

Requirements:

- Python 3

Run `start.bat` to install everything and start the program.

To kill, right click an indicator and click "Exit"
